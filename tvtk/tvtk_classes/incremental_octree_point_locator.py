    """
    IncrementalOctreePointLocator - Incremental octree in support
     of both point location and point insertion.
    
    Superclass: IncrementalPointLocator
    
    As opposed to the uniform bin-based search structure (adopted in
    class
     PointLocator) with a fixed spatial resolution, an octree
    mechanism
     employs a hierarchy of tree-like sub-division of the 3d data domain.
    Thus
     it enables data-aware multi-resolution and accordingly accelerated
    point
     location as well as insertion, particularly when handling a
    radically
     imbalanced layout of points as not uncommon in datasets defined on
     adaptive meshes. Compared to a static point locator supporting pure
     location functionalities through some search structure established
    from
     a fixed set of points, an incremental point locator allows for, in
    addition,
     point insertion capabilities, with the search structure maintaining
    a
     dynamically increasing number of points.
     Class IncrementalOctreePointLocator is an octree-based
    accelerated
     implementation of the functionalities of the uniform bin-based
    incremental
     point locator PointLocator. For point location, an octree is
    built by
     accessing a DataSet, specifically a PointSet. For point
    insertion,
     an empty octree is inited and then incrementally populated as points
    are
     inserted. Three increasingly complex point insertion modes, i.e.,
    direct
     check-free insertion, zero tolerance insertion, and non-zero
    tolerance
     insertion, are supported. In fact, the octree used in the point
    location
     mode is actually constructed via direct check-free point insertion.
    This
     class also provides a polygonal representation of the octree
    boundary.
