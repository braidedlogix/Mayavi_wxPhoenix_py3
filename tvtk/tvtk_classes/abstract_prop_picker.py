    AbstractPropPicker - abstract API for pickers that can pick an
    instance of Prop
    
    Superclass: AbstractPicker
    
    AbstractPropPicker is an abstract superclass for pickers that can
    pick an instance of Prop. Some pickers, like WorldPointPicker
    (not a subclass of this class), cannot identify the prop that is
    picked. Subclasses of AbstractPropPicker return a prop in the form
    of a AssemblyPath when a pick is invoked. Note that an
    AssemblyPath contain a list of AssemblyNodes, each of which in
    turn contains a reference to a Prop and a 4x4 transformation
    matrix. The path fully describes the entire pick path, so you can
    pick assemblies or portions of assemblies, or just grab the tail end
    of the AssemblyPath (which is the picked prop).
    
    @warning
    Because a Prop can be placed into different assemblies, or even in
    different leaf positions of the same assembly, the AssemblyPath is
    used to fully qualify exactly which use of the Prop was picked,
    including its position (since AssemblyPath includes a
    transformation matrix per node).
    
    @warning
    The class returns information about picked actors, props, etc. Note
    that what is returned by these methods is the top level of the
    assembly path. This can cause a lot of confusion! For example, if you
    pick a Assembly, and the returned AssemblyPath has as a leaf a
    Actor, then if you invoke get_actor(), you will get NULL, even
    though an actor was indeed picked. (_get_assembly() will return
    something.) Note that the safest thing to do is to do a
    get_view_prop(), which will always return something if something was
    picked. A better way to manage picking is to work with
    AssemblyPath, since this completely defines the pick path from top
    to bottom in a assembly hierarchy, and avoids confusion when the same
    prop is used in different assemblies.
    
    @warning
    The returned assembly paths refer to assembly nodes that in turn
    refer to Prop and Matrix. This association to Prop is not a
    reference counted association, meaning that dangling references are
    possible if you do a pick, get an assembly path, and then delete a
    Prop. (Reason: assembly paths create many self-referencing loops
    that destroy reference counting.)
