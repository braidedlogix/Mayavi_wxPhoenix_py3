    CellPicker - ray-cast cell picker for all kinds of prop3ds
    
    Superclass: Picker
    
    CellPicker will shoot a ray into a 3d scene and return information
    about the first object that the ray hits.  It works for all prop3ds.
    For Volume objects, it shoots a ray into the volume and returns
    the point where the ray intersects an isosurface of a chosen opacity.
    For Image objects, it intersects the ray with the displayed slice.
    For Actor objects, it intersects the actor's polygons. If the
    object's mapper has clipping_planes, then it takes the clipping into
    account, and will return the Id of the clipping plane that was
    intersected. For all prop types, it returns point and cell
    information, plus the normal of the surface that was intersected at
    the pick position.  For volumes and images, it also returns (i,j,k)
    coordinates for the point and the cell that were picked.
