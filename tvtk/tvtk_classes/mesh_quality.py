    """
    MeshQuality - Calculate functions of quality of the elements
     of a mesh
    
    Superclass: DataSetAlgorithm
    
    MeshQuality computes one or more functions of (geometric) quality
    for each 2-D and 3-D cell (triangle, quadrilateral, tetrahedron, or
    hexahedron) of a mesh. These functions of quality are then averaged
    over the entire mesh. The minimum, average, maximum, and unbiased
    variance of quality for each type of cell is stored in the output
    mesh's field_data. The field_data arrays are named "Mesh Triangle
    Quality," "Mesh Quadrilateral Quality," "Mesh Tetrahedron Quality,"
    and "Mesh Hexahedron Quality." Each array has a single tuple with 5
    components. The first 4 components are the quality statistics
    mentioned above; the final value is the number of cells of the given
    type. This final component makes aggregation of statistics for
    distributed mesh data possible.
    
    By default, the per-cell quality is added to the mesh's cell data, in
    an array named "Quality." Cell types not supported by this filter
    will have an entry of 0. Use save_cell_quality_off() to store only the
    final statistics.
    
    This version of the filter written by Philippe Pebay and David
    Thompson overtakes an older version written by Leila Baghdadi, Hanif
    Ladak, and David Steinman at the Imaging Research Labs, Robarts
    Research Institute. That version only supported tetrahedral radius
    ratio. See the compatibility_mode_on() member for information on how to
    make this filter behave like the previous implementation. For more
    information on the triangle quality functions of this class, cf.
    Pebay & Baker 2003, Analysis of triangle quality measures, Math Comp
    72:244. For more information on the quadrangle quality functions of
    this class, cf. Pebay 2004, Planar Quadrangle Quality Measures, Eng
    Comp 20:2.
    
    @warning
    While more general than before, this class does not address many cell
    types, including wedges and pyramids in 3d and triangle strips and
    fans in 2d (among others). Most quadrilateral quality functions are
    intended for planar quadrilaterals only. The minimal angle is not,
    strictly speaking, a quality function, but it is provided because of
    its usage by many authors.

        compatibility_mode governs whether, when both a quality function
        and cell volume are to be stored as cell data, the two values are
        stored in a single array. When compatibility mode is off (the
        default), two separate arrays are used -- one labeled "Quality"
        and the other labeled "Volume". When compatibility mode is on,
        both values are stored in a single array, with volume as the
        first component and quality as the second component.
        
        * Enabling compatibility_mode changes the default tetrahedral
        * quality function to VTK_QUALITY_RADIUS_RATIO and turns volume
        * computation on. (This matches the default behavior of the
        * initial implementation of MeshQuality.) You may change
        * quality function and volume computation without leaving
        * compatibility mode.
        
        * Disabling compatibility mode does not affect the current

        * its setting, the resulting array will be of type DoubleArray
        * rather than the original FloatArray.
