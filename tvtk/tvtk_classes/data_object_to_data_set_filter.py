    DataObjectToDataSetFilter - map field data to concrete dataset
    
    Superclass: DataSetAlgorithm
    
    DataObjectToDataSetFilter is an class that maps a data object
    (i.e., a field) into a concrete dataset, i.e., gives structure to the
    field by defining a geometry and topology.
    
    To use this filter you associate components in the input field data
    with portions of the output dataset. (A component is an array of
    values from the field.) For example, you would specify x-y-z points
    by assigning components from the field for the x, then y, then z
    values of the points. You may also have to specify component ranges
    (for each z-y-z) to make sure that the number of x, y, and z values
    is the same. Also, you may want to normalize the components which
    helps distribute the data uniformly. Once you've setup the filter to
    combine all the pieces of data into a specified dataset (the
    geometry, topology, point and cell data attributes), the various
    output methods (e.g., get_poly_data()) are used to retrieve the final
    product.
    
    This filter is often used in conjunction with
    FieldDataToAttributeDataFilter.  FieldDataToAttributeDataFilter
    takes field data and transforms it into attribute data (e.g., point
    and cell data attributes such as scalars and vectors).  To do this,
    use this filter which constructs a concrete dataset and passes the
    input data object field data to its output. and then use
    FieldDataToAttributeDataFilter to generate the attribute data
    associated with the dataset.
    
    @warning
    Make sure that the data you extract is consistent. That is, if you
    have N points, extract N x, y, and z components. Also, all the
    information necessary to define a dataset must be given. For example,
    PolyData requires points at a minimum; StructuredPoints
    requires setting the dimensions; StructuredGrid requires defining
    points and dimensions; UnstructuredGrid requires setting points;
    and RectilinearGrid requires that you define the x, y, and
    z-coordinate arrays (by specifying points) as well as the dimensions.
    
    @warning
    If you wish to create a dataset of just points (i.e., unstructured
    points dataset), create PolyData consisting of points. There will
    be no cells in such a dataset.
