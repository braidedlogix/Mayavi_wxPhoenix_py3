    QuadricClustering - reduce the number of triangles in a mesh
    
    Superclass: PolyDataAlgorithm
    
    QuadricClustering is a filter to reduce the number of triangles in
    a triangle mesh, forming a good approximation to the original
    geometry.  The input to QuadricClustering is a PolyData object,
    and all types of polygonal data are handled.
    
    The algorithm used is the one described by Peter Lindstrom in his
    Siggraph 2000 paper, "Out-of-Core Simplification of Large Polygonal
    Models."  The general approach of the algorithm is to cluster
    vertices in a uniform binning of space, accumulating the quadric of
    each triangle (pushed out to the triangles vertices) within each bin,
    and then determining an optimal position for a single vertex in a bin
    by using the accumulated quadric. In more detail, the algorithm first
    gets the bounds of the input poly data. It then breaks this bounding
    volume into a user-specified number of spatial bins.  It then reads
    each triangle from the input and hashes its vertices into these bins.
     (If this is the first time a bin has been visited, initialize its
    quadric to the 0 matrix.) The algorithm computes the error quadric
    for this triangle and adds it to the existing quadric of the bin in
    which each vertex is contained. Then, if 2 or more vertices of the
    triangle fall in the same bin, the triangle is dicarded.  If the
    triangle is not discarded, it adds the triangle to the list of output
    triangles as a list of vertex identifiers.  (There is one vertex id
    per bin.)  After all the triangles have been read, the representative
    vertex for each bin is computed (an optimal location is found) using
    the quadric for that bin.  This determines the spatial location of
    the vertices of each of the triangles in the output.
    
    To use this filter, specify the divisions defining the spatial
    subdivision in the x, y, and z directions. You must also specify an
    input PolyData. Then choose to either 1) use the original points
    that minimize the quadric error to produce the output triangles or 2)
    compute an optimal position in each bin to produce the output
    triangles (recommended and default behavior).
    
    This filter can take multiple inputs.  To do this, the user must
    explicity call start_append, Append (once for each input), and
    end_append.  start_append sets up the data structure to hold the
    quadric matrices.  Append processes each triangle in the input poly
    data it was called on, hashes its vertices to the appropriate bins,
    determines whether to keep this triangle, and updates the appropriate
    quadric matrices.  end_append determines the spatial location of each
    of the representative vertices for the visited bins. While this
    approach does not fit into the visualization architecture and
    requires manual control, it has the advantage that extremely large
    data can be processed in pieces and appended to the filter
    piece-by-piece.
    
    @warning
    This filter can drastically affect topology, i.e., topology is not
    preserved.
    
    @warning
    The filter handles input triangle strips and arbitrary polygons.
    Arbitrary polygons are assumed convex: during insertion they are
    triangulated using a fan of triangles from the first point in the
    polygons. If the polygon is concave, this can produce bad results. In
    this case, use TriangleFilter to triangulate the polygons first.
    
    @warning
    The filter also treats polylines and vertices.
    
    @warning
    Note that for certain types of geometry (e.g., a mostly 2d plane with
    jitter in the normal direction), the decimator can perform badly. In
    this sitation, set the number of bins in the normal direction to one.
